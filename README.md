Project Overview: Comprehensive Data Analysis for Growia

As part of my journey through the Growia Data Analyst Certification Program, I conducted a thorough analysis of e-commerce performance data from the Olist platform, a leading online marketplace in Brazil. This project focused on gaining actionable insights from vast datasets to help optimize business performance and enhance customer satisfaction.

Key Highlights:

Customer Behavior Analysis: I explored patterns in customer preferences, purchase habits, and satisfaction levels across various product categories. The insights helped in understanding which segments showed the highest engagement and which areas needed improvement.

Sales and Payment Trend Analysis: By analyzing payment methods and transaction volumes, I identified the dominant use of credit cards (75.2% of orders), with boleto and other minor methods offering strategic opportunities for growth.

Order Performance Over Time: My analysis of order activity over different periods revealed crucial peaks during promotional periods, such as Black Friday, which is vital for formulating future marketing strategies.

Product Category Performance: Insights into top-performing categories, such as Beauty & Health and Home & Bath, helped pinpoint products that consistently delivered high sales, while also uncovering seasonal variations in product demand.

Regional Insights: The data highlighted geographic concentrations, with São Paulo (46% of customers) dominating the market, pointing towards the importance of regional strategies in product distribution and marketing.

Customer Satisfaction and Value: By examining customer satisfaction levels and order value distributions, I identified opportunities for increasing average order value (AOV) through targeted strategies aimed at low-value customers.

Strategic Recommendations:

Based on my findings, I provided actionable business recommendations, including optimizing stock for top-selling products, enhancing customer loyalty programs, and experimenting with pricing and discounts to improve overall customer retention and conversion rates.

Cross-Sell and Upsell strategies were also proposed to maximize revenue, particularly for customers in the ‘Champion’ and ‘Loyal’ segments, while also focusing on win-back campaigns for at-risk customers.

Technological & Analytical Tools Used:

Python for data analysis and visualization

SQL for data querying and cleaning

Jupyter Notebooks for presenting insights

Tableau for creating visual dashboards that succinctly communicated findings to stakeholders

This project not only enhanced my technical skills in data analysis but also my ability to translate complex data into actionable business insights. I look forward to applying these skills to future roles in data analytics and business intelligence.
